# neural-network-handwritten-numbers

## Hello. This is a multilayer perceptron neural network in JavaScript.

Neural network was created and trained to recognize 10 handwritten numbers from 0 to 9.

She has already been trained and is able to recognize handwritten numbers.
The project will be gradually updated, the ability to train, load other weights, and view the insides of the neural network will be added to find out how it works better.

Dataset for training: [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database)
