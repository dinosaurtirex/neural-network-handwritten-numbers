# neural-network-handwritten-numbers

Hello. This is a multilayer perceptron neural network.<br/><br/>
She has already been trained and is able to recognize handwritten numbers.
The project will be gradually updated, the ability to train, load other weights, and view the insides of the neural network will be added to find out how it works better.
